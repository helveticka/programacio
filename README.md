# Programació - 20302/21707

## Content
Here there are stored each one of the projects done on each part of the subject (Programació I & Programació II)

### P_I: wordle
In this directory is stored my very first programming project, which I created both at university and in my life. It's an implementation of the popular game Wordle, made using Java. The main objective was to manipulate strings and files, while developing simple algorithms to introduce myself to the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

### P_II: puzzle
This folder stores the project for the second part of the course, 'Programming II'. The goal was to manipulate the Java GUI to develop an interactive game with a graphical interface. A puzzle game was developed, which allows for manipulating image files, creating various interactive classes, and implementing a fairly complex algorithmic logic.
